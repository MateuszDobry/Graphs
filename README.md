GRAPHS

This project implements various graph algorithms in C++. It allows for the traversal of graphs using Depth-First Search (DFS), checks if a graph is bipartite, and manages graph structures. 
The project also includes functionality for coloring the graph's vertices according to specific rules and sorting data as needed.
The main program orchestrates these operations, enabling users to analyze and manipulate graph data effectively.
